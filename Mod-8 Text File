List of Errors on BooTheDog.html (Module-8)

1. Line 19 - missing <h1> tags
2. Lines 28-32 using <h4> tags instead of <p> tags
3. Text box is missing <p> tags and is one big chunk. 
4.</div> closing "<div class="row"> out of place. (Aesthetic?) 
5. Missing "<>" around "img class"\
6. Missing list tags
7. The "textOrange"... were mixed up.

I was having trouble with the Javascript for a while. There were some small errors like missed quotation marks and so forth.The biggest issue I had to figure out was to resave the .js file and link it to the .html so that it would run the corrected code. 

I faced similar issues in Module-6, so hopefully I'll have time to go back to Mod-6 and fix those errors.

This exercise really helped!
